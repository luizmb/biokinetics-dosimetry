// MARK: - StackEntry

/// One entry on the navigation stack: **its route identity and its state, inseparable**.
///
/// The stack is `[StackEntry]` — one source of truth. There is no parallel table of per-screen state to
/// keep in step, so "a route with no state" and "state for a screen that isn't on the stack" are not
/// merely avoided, they are unrepresentable. Pushing is appending a fully-formed screen; popping is
/// `removeLast`. Nothing to seed afterwards, nothing to prune.
///
/// It lives in AppCore rather than AppDomain because it carries feature states, and AppDomain cannot see
/// the feature modules. ``AppRoute`` — the payload-free identity SwiftUI navigates by — stays in the
/// domain, where it is a pure DTO.
